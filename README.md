# graphs_from_degs

A simple algorithm that searches for all possible graphs up to isomorphism whose vertices satisfy a certain degree pattern. It is a pretty straightforward algorithm that uses a brute force approach

To use, specify the pattern in the list "d"

I developed this project when I was taking the course on Discrete Maths to help me solve one exercise
